    <p>Greetings! Here is the website I made for the Final Project in the Advanced Styling with Responsive Design course in Coursera. The layout of the page like the div of the page
      will change based on the size of the screen. So it will be responsive to any changes that you make to the screen. This is done through media queries that are written in the
      styles.css file.
      <br> <br>
        As for the content of the page, I just decided to insert NBA players in it. I like the NBA and here are some of the best NBA players. Some of them are not what they used to be
        but when they were in their prime, they were tearing up the league. Of course you have THE GOAT Lebron James, then Russell Westbrook who gets so much hate even though he is a nice person,
        And next is Kevin Durant who is a lethal shooter and arguably the greatest scorer of all time. Giannis "Greek Freak" Antetokounmpo which is my favorite player. James Harden who used
        to average 37ppg but now is the 3rd option behing PG and Kawhi. Nikola Jokic who is a back to back MVP winner. Kyrie Irving who has arguably the greatest handles of all time. Luka Doncic
        who has a very promising future ahead of him. And we can't forget about Stephen Curry, the greatest shooter of all time.
